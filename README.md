# 🎓 Student Score Predictor

An end-to-end Machine Learning web app that predicts student academic performance based on study habits and lifestyle factors — with Explainable AI and personalized recommendations to explain and improve results.

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://academic-score-ai.streamlit.app

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was built as part of a personal data science learning journey before starting an MSc in Data Science. It covers the complete Machine Learning lifecycle — from data generation and exploratory data analysis to model training, explainability, deployment, and recommendation generation.

Unlike traditional prediction apps, this project not only predicts student performance but also explains why a prediction occurred and provides personalized suggestions for improvement.

## 📊 Dataset

Synthetic dataset generated using realistic academic patterns and relationships.

Features used:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Hours Studied | Daily study hours (1–9) |
| Previous Scores | Previous exam score (40–100) |
| Extracurricular Activities | Yes / No |
| Sleep Hours | Hours slept per day (4–9) |
| Sample Question Papers Practiced | Practice count (0–9) |
| Performance Index | Target variable (0–100) |

Dataset values were created with realistic dependencies among academic and lifestyle factors.

## 🤖 Models Trained

| Model | RMSE | R² |
|---|---:|---:|
| Linear Regression | 4.91 | 0.88 ✅ |
| Gradient Boosting | 5.00 | 0.87 |
| XGBoost | 5.35 | 0.86 |
| Random Forest | 5.44 | 0.85 |

Linear Regression was selected as the final model because it achieved the highest R² score while maintaining simpler interpretability and explainability.

---

## 🔍 Explainability

Each prediction includes:

- SHAP Feature Contribution Chart
- Plain-English explanation
- Positive and negative contribution analysis

Example:

> "Hours Studied increased your predicted score by +15 points"

---

## 🧠 Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine uses feature contribution values to identify weak areas and generate personalized suggestions.

Examples:

- Increase study hours
- Improve sleep schedule
- Practice more sample papers
- Maintain consistency in strong areas

Recommendations dynamically change based on:

- Feature contribution values
- Grade level
- Student performance patterns

If no negative factors are found, the app displays a positive feedback card indicating strong overall balance.

---

## 📜 Prediction History

The app stores previous prediction results so users can track inputs and compare trends over time.

History includes:

- Timestamp
- Hours Studied
- Previous Scores
- Sleep Hours
- Practice Papers
- Extracurricular Activity
- Predicted Score
